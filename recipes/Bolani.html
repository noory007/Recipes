    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>These filling suggestions are just the beginning! Stuff your bolani with whatever suits your fancy. I have seen particularly tasty-looking recipes stuffed with sweet potatoes, and another filled almost entirely with leeks  yumm!
        These are my potato stuffed bolani. I personally like the spinach filling a bit more, but there are pretty darn tasty, too!
        To save time, you could make and refrigerate all the parts ahead of time. Just pull your dough out of the fridge to rest at room temperature for about 45 minutes before rolling it out and putting everything together.
