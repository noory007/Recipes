    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Some key pointers when making pulao are. Do not let your rice get sticky and do not think of this as some “health dish.” The dish should be rich and delicious. It is a special occasion food.

        Lets talk about ingredients. Below, you can see the main stars of the dish: carrots, raisins, lamb, and one last secret ingredient I added in this new recipe…..sesame oil! I have researched this recipe for hours. I have read dozens and dozens of videos. Sesame oil is truly a secret ingredient that most people overlook. But trust me, it is crucial.   
    </p>
    <p>Lets talk “masala”. You have heard that word a lot, I am sure. It just means some spice mixture. Here, we use our char masala recipe. This masala includes black cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and cumin. The one spice you might not have tried before is black cardamom. It has an intoxicating aroma. Black cardamom pods have a rich, smoky aroma. They are dried over a fire.</p>
