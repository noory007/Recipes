    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Learning a mantu recipe is key to mastering Afghan cuisine. Unfortunately, this dish takes some time and making it is reserved for special occasions. However, I share some tips below on how to make it easier.
        The mantu is a thin dough that is filled with beef or lamb mixed in onions and spices. The steamed foodstuff then tops it off with an orange sauce made from chaka (thick creamy strained yogurt), giving this dish its unique taste!
